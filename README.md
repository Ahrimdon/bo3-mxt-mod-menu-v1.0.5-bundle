## Disclaimer 
* I am not the owner this. This is simply a repack made by Ahrimdon. 
* Credit goes to [MXT](https://discord.gg/dBd4UNn4tV) for the Mod Menu and [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) for the .dll injection program.
* I, nor the MXT crew are responsible for any bans, if they should occur for whatever reason.
* [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) is a fully open-source project, therefore it ***should*** be safe.
* MXT Menu v1.0.5 (Old) & MXT Menu v1.0.6 (New) is available at the [MXT Crew's PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/HhrHktyw).
* With all that being said, continue at **YOUR OWN RISK**!

## Please Note
* If you choose to use this menu, I STRONGLY advice against using the ```"unlock all achievements"``` button, along with scripting and injecting modified stat files as those have ***THE HIGHEST*** chance of getting you banned. Everything else is still safe as of ```9/3/2022```.
* I also **HIGHLY** advise ***AGAINST*** using the menu in public lobbies or even play with the menu at all. This menu is strictly for unlocking Liquid Divinium, black market items/camos, modding your level and should not be used and abused for legitimate play.
* If the MXT Menu file will not download, you may have to temporarily disable antivirus, however that is **VERY** rare, I didn't myself and neither has anyone I've given this too, if you absolutely must, make sure to turn it back on **IMMEDIATELY** after!

# Instructions
### 1. Extract all the files into a folder somewhere.

### 2. Open Process Hacker.exe (x86 or x64 depending on whether your systems 32-bit or 64-bit), most modern systems are 64-bit.

### 3. Start Black Ops 3 and go to the zombies or multiplayer main menu (where you see ```"Find Game"```).

### 4. Maximize Process Hacker and find bo3.exe in the list of running applications.

### 5. Right click on bo3.exe --### Misc. (Miscellaneous) --### Inject .dll

### 6. It will then prompt you for a file, find ```MXT Menu v1.0.5``` in the prompt and select it.

### 7. Minimize Process Hacker.exe (do not close it) and go back into your game.

### 8. A menu should appear, if it doesn't then hit ```F5``` on your keyboard to toggle it.

### 9. From here you can set level to 1,000, inject modded stat files, spoof black market items and auto give/spend LD and black market Keys!

### 10. To give LD, go to the bottom and expand the option that gives you LD.

### 11. Select ZM for game mode, set interval to 600, set VATs to 3 and check start! You'll start seeing your LD going up!

### 12. When you want to stop, simply uncheck and expand to the auto-spender below it. Set the options to the same as above (ZM, 3, 600).

### 13. Check start and you'll see your LD go down! For each LD lost, you'll get 1 random gobble gum.

# Tips
* Do not run the auto-giver and auto-spender at the same time.
* If your LD stops giving or spending then uncheck and recheck start. (Mess around with the interval and eventually it will go forever)
* When using the black market spoofer, you have to create custom loadouts with the dark matter camo on for the camo to save.
* To get rid of the mod menu, simply restart your game.
